Did you know Bocconi University offers access to a High Performance Computing (HPC) system for its students? And do you actually know how to use it?

We organized a hands-on tutorial session where our co-founder and vice-president [Giacomo Cirò](https://giacomo-ciro.github.io/) covered:

- What the HPC is and its specs  
- How to request access and set up the SSH keys  
- How to connect remotely via VPN  
- How to submit, monitor, and cancel jobs using SLURM  
- Basic Linux commands to work on the cluster  

We can’t wait to host more of these hands-on practice sessions. See you at the next ones !
