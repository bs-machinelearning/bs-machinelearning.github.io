Wow, what a wonderful BSML first ever internal event!

We finally had the **Presentation Aperitivo** with our new members. It was wonderful to meet everyone and connect those minds.

Our **Head of Production**, *Giacomo Cir√≤*, illustrated the story of how our founders came up with and conceived the idea of this association, and what it took to finally begin this journey together. He then shared our goals and all the activities we have in mind and want to pursue in the future, introducing the project he's going to lead.

Our **President**, *Giulio Caputi*, showcased his experience at **Amazon** to give our members an insight into how Machine Learning is used in tech companies to solve real business problems, and how he used it to tune Database Management Systems.

Our **Head of Research**, *Alessandro Morosini*, presented the other projects we are going to pursue this semester, explaining how research is carried out inside BSML. Eventually, he announced the first challenge we are going to host and the prize.
