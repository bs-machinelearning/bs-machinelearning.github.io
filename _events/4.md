Recently, OpenAI announced **Operator**, the first AI agentic model that can complete real tasks on the Internet for its users, like ordering groceries and booking a flight. AI agents are the next frontier of AI products. They are models that can actively engage with their environment, make decisions, and execute complex tasks autonomously.

After graduating from Columbia University, *Thomas Mecattaf* founded *Leger Labs*, a VC-backed AI company that helps organisations build private AI agents. He also decided to pursue a PhD in Business Administration and Management at Bocconi University to enhance his skills as a technology entrepreneur.

Thomas is conducting deep industry research on AI agents to understand their capabilities, and he gave us a comprehensive overview on this topic from real-world case studies to ethical considerations, and the impact on jobs, industry and the entire economy. We explored:

- Large Language Models (LLM) & Large Action Models (LAM)  
- Research opportunities for students in this space  
- The intersection of entrepreneurship & academia in AI  
- How AI agents will reshape industries beyond tech  

Thank you to our super guest and all of you who participated.
