During our last event co-organized with <a class="text-link" href="https://hephaestusai.eu/">Hephaestus AI</a>, we brought together legal, technical, and academic perspectives to explore how tech research becomes real-world technology—and how regulation and ethics shape that journey.

A huge thank you to our speakers <u>Guenda Sciancalepore</u> (Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft) and <u>Veronica M. Pruinelli</u> (lawyer specialized in AI regulation). We discussed:

- How research teams work and deliver impact  
- How to translate AI ideas into AI products  
- The balance between innovation and regulation  
- Ethical challenges of deploying AI at scale  

At BSML, we aim to connect minds, not only layers—thank you for being part of the conversation.
