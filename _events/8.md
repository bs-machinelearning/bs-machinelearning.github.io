After our Welcome Aperitivo, we can officially start BSML's third year! 

Our members had the opportunity to find out about the projects that our association will be working on this semester. These projects cover themes such as environmental risk, healthcare, portfolio management and cybersecurity. The student groups will work on their projects over the coming months, and we can't wait to see the results!

After the presentation, old and new members had the opportunity to get to know each other and exchange information, which was invaluable for kickstarting their academic careers!

Do you have an idea in mind or are already working on a project? Join and publish with us!
