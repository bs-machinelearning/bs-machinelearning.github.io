Projects kick-start your career. Yet, no one teaches you how to choose what projects to pursue and, most importantly, how to find your why.

*Andrea Parodi* (Bending Spoons) and *Lucabrando Sanfilippo* (Techno-Humanist) are founders of [Brightdale](https://brightdale.com), an education-oriented start-up that aims at increasing students’ “surface area of luck”.

After years of experience in tech start-ups and companies, from San Francisco to Berlin, they want to mentor the next generation of talent.

They talked about how to find the right projects to pursue, how ambition can become your enemy, finding your authentic definition of success, applying the 0-to-1 framework to your life, and much more.

A big thank you to our special guests and everyone who joined, making it an incredible night!
