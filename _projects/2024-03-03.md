The goal of this project is to enhance the Bocconi FAQ by creating a chatbot powered by GPT-3.5. We collected data directly from the you@b website
to fine-tune a model and make it able to answer student questions.

In February, 2024 we finally announced the release of the first Bocconi Chatbot, try it out!
