We are building an adaptive machine-learning model for dynamic asset allocation that updates portfolio weights in response to evolving market data. The project focuses on predictive modeling and reinforcement or regression-based optimization to balance risk and return and evaluate performance using metrics like Sharpe ratio and drawdowns.
