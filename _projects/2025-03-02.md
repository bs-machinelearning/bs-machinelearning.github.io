Which house feature is the most location-dependent? - Marco Lomele, Giovanni Mantovani, Letizia Dimonopoli, and Sofia Villa explore this question in their latest project.
> Which house feature is the most location-dependent?

They find that different house open-roles (number of bedrooms, parking spaces, distance from the centerâ€¦) affect house prices differently across Melbourne's council areas. In particular, distance has the most variable effect while building area is the most consistent.

In their approach they implement:

* Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling (Python PyMC)
* Mixed-Effects Model with spatial random slopes
* Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) Prior for spatial dependencies
* Inference using No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) for robust MCMC estimation
