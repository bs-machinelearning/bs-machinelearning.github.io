We are developing a computational replica to model tumor growth, evolution, and response to treatment using predictive modeling.

</div>
<br>
Focusing on combining biological, clinical, and molecular data to build a simulation model of disease dynamics that can capture how a condition evolves over time under different therapies, enabling personalized risk assessment and treatment prediction.
