**Escape The Challenge** is a semester-long Data Science and Entrepreneurship competition co-organized with [theHackLab Bocconi Students](https://thehacklab.org/).

Participants presented their solutions to judges from [BCG X](https://www.bcg.com/x/) and [Bocconi for Innovation (B4i)](https://www.b4i.unibocconi.it/), gaining valuable feedback and insights.

Push your limits and compete in one of two tracks:

- *Data Track*: Uncover and tell the story behind user decision-making.  
- *Entrepreneur Track*: Design a product that attracts and retains users.
