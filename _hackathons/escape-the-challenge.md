**Escape The Challenge** is a semester-long Data Science and Entrepreneurship competition co-organized with *theHackLab Bocconi Students*.

Participants presented their solutions to judges from *BCG X* and *Bocconi for Innovation (B4i)*, gaining valuable feedback and insights.

Push your limits and compete in one of two tracks:

- *Data Track*: Uncover and tell the story behind user decision-making.  
- *Entrepreneur Track*: Design a product that attracts and retains users.
