                            We learn a variety of abilities throughout our lives by imitation, trial and error, and intuition. Now, machines can 
                            "learn" similarly to us and Reinforcement Learning (RL) holds the key to teaching them.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            RL may seem like a new topic, but it actually dates to the early days of cybernetics and work in statistics, 
                            psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. Due to its generality, RL is studied in many disciplines, such 
                            as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent 
                            systems, swarm intelligence, and statistics.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            In simple words, RL makes a model figure out how to complete a task on its own, learning from its past mistakes 
                            based on how much it is “rewarded”. It is akin to what we humans call trial and error, which evaluates our performance 
                            based on how well we did and determines the next action accordingly.
                         </p>
                         <h3>
                            How does it work?
                         </h3>
                         <p>
                            RL is composed of 4 main elements: the agent, the environment, the policy of the agent and the reward based on actions.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The <b>agent</b> (or <b>learner</b>) makes the decision of what action to take in a specific scenario. 
                                    To make such a decision, the agent observes the environment and any internal rules it has. Typically, the 
                                    current state is an exogenous variable provided by the environment, which is processed by the agent using 
                                    a policy function.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The <b>environment</b> is the world context in which the agent operates. It is a model or simulation the 
                                    agent interacts with by taking actions, receiving rewards or penalties, and moving to new states based on 
                                    those actions. The environment provides the agent with its initial state and the current state after each 
                                    action. It also determines the reward associated with each state-action pair. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The <b>policyt</b> is the exact strategy an agent implies to reach its goal. It dictates the actions the 
                                    agent is supposed to execute as a function of the current state.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The <b>reward</b> is what motivates the agent, so it has an incentive and a form of evaluation when 
                                    progressing or completing its goal. Without rewards, agents would have no way of evaluating their actions 
                                    and would be unlikely to make any progress in completing their assigned task or solve a certain control 
                                    problem. Rewards provide feedback to the agent, allowing it to learn and adapt its strategy.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            Bringing together these 4 components, you are able to create a complete RL learning algorithm. The RL problem 
                            involves the agent exploring an unknown environment to achieve a goal. It is based on the hypothesis that all 
                            goals can be described by the maximization of expected cumulative reward. The agent must learn to sense and 
                            perturb the state of the environment using its actions to attain the maximal score.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Advantages of Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                        <p>
                            Compared to other types of Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning has some clear advantages when it comes 
                            to the process of learning and the results that come with it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, conversely to supervised learning, RL lacks the need of large labeled datasets. It's a massive 
                            advantage because as the amount of data in the world grows, it becomes more and more costly to label it for 
                            all required applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another advantage is the innovative aspect. The fact it can not only imitate the data structure, but come up 
                            with a new way to solve a problem altogether puts it ahead of any other algorithm or method when it comes to 
                            actual “learning”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A third advantage is that it's goal oriented. It is not just used to get an output from input data, but as 
                            means to obtain a sequence of optimal actions. This is apparent in self-driving cars, or bots in video games.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The biggest edge reinforcement learning has over machine is its ability to adapt. Being able to learn from 
                            past mistakes and deduce the best course of action according to your environment is single-handedly the 
                            greatest advantage that puts it over any other method or form of learning.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Real-Life Applications of Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                        <h4>Automation</h4>
                        <p>
                            Robots are programmable machines designed to perform tasks autonomously. Even if most robots we have don't 
                            look like they belong to the Star Wars universe, their capabilities are no less amazing and through RL they 
                            can improve their accuracy and speed up their completion of difficult tasks. They can also carry out tasks 
                            that humans might find perilous with significantly fewer repercussions. Because of these factors, aside from 
                            the fact that they need supervision and ongoing upkeep, robots are an affordable and productive substitute for manual labor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Robots, for instance, are used by certain restaurants to bring meals to tables. Robots are being used by 
                            grocery retailers to detect low shelf areas and place additional goods orders. Thus far, automated robots 
                            have been employed in common environments for product assembly, defect inspection, inventory counting, 
                            tracking and management, and delivery of goods.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Language</h4>
                        <p>
                            Predictive text, text summarization, question answering, and machine translation are all examples of natural 
                            language processing that uses reinforcement learning. By studying typical language patterns, agents can mimic 
                            and predict how people speak to each other every day. This includes the actual language used, as well as syntax 
                            and the choice of words.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2016, researchers from Stanford University, Ohio State University, and Microsoft Research used this learning 
                            to generate dialogue, like what's used for chatbots. Using two virtual agents, they simulated conversations and 
                            used policy gradient methods to reward important attributes such as coherence, informativity, and ease of answering. 
                            This research was unique in that it didn't only focus on the question at hand, but also on how an answer could influence 
                            future outcomes. This approach to reinforcement learning in natural language processing is now widely adopted and 
                            used by customer service departments in many major organizations.
                        
                        </p>
                        <h4>Image Processing</h4>
                        <p>
                            Have you ever taken a security test that asked you to identify objects in frames, such as “Click on the photos that 
                            have a street sign in them”? This is in fact a way to train Ais to become better at detecting objects. A method widely 
                            used is the “Captcha” you may see around the web.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When asked to process an image, agents will search for an entire image as their starting point, then identify objects 
                            sequentially until everything is registered. Artificial vision systems also use deep convolutional neural networks, 
                            made up of large, labeled datasets, to map images to human-generated scene descriptions from simulation engines.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Self-Driving Cars</h4>
                        <p>
                            Various papers have proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning for autonomous driving. In self-driving cars, there are 
                            various aspects to consider, such as speed limits at various places, drivable zones, avoiding collisions - just to mention a few.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the autonomous driving tasks where reinforcement learning could be applied include trajectory optimization, 
                            motion planning, dynamic pathing, controller optimization, and scenario-based learning policies for highways.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, parking can be achieved by learning automatic parking policies. Lane changing can be achieved using 
                            Q-Learning while overtaking can be implemented by learning an overtaking policy while avoiding collision and 
                            maintaining a steady speed thereafter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous racing car that has been designed to test out in a physical track. It uses cameras 
                            to visualize the runway and a reinforcement learning model to control the throttle and direction.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            Reinforcement Learning provides interesting and refreshing application possibilities in a wide range of industries 
                            and opens up entirely new horizons through the use of neural networks and artificial intelligence. The outlook for 
                            the future is bright. As machine learning and artificial intelligence progresses, more potent RL-algorithms will emerge. 
                            The increasing scalability and effectiveness RL techniques will make them more widely applicable. Furthermore, 
                            advancements in the creation of hybrid approaches— such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) which merges RL with Deep 
                            Learning (DL)—are anticipated to tackle even more challenging issues. Due to all this, RL is set to become a crucial 
                            tool for tackling complicated problems.
